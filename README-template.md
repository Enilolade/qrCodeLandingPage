## Overview
This challenge involved creating a qr code landing page.
It used only html and css. Tried to make it as responsive as possible too as screen size changes.

## My process
I created the structure with html using tags <main>, <div>, <h1>, <p> and <footer>
1 Created the container for the qr code in the <main> and with a <div> with class qr-container
2 Added the image of the qr code using the <img> tag
3 Created a container for the texts also using <div> and gave it a class name text-container
4 Inserted the texts for the <h1> and <p> in the text-container respectively.

After getting the structure or order in which I wanted the elements to appear, I began styling using css
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
